 <h3>What is an earthquake?</h3>
      <p>There are several sources that provide a more or less comprehensive definition of earthquake; one of the most detailed, but
        understandable, explanations is provided by the U.S. Geological Survey <a href=https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/science-earthquakes target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(USGS)</a> ,
        the sole science agency for the Department of the Interior,
        in their official website which is reported here:"An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth 
        suddenly slip past one another. 
        The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter,
        and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter."
        The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, 
        and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. </p>

<h3>Why Do Earthquakes Happen? </h3>
        <p>In simple terms, earthquakes are caused by those movements generated by the Earth's tectonic plates.
            When these plates move towards each other, as a result, one can be pushed down and slip inside the mantle.
          Although the Earth looks like a pretty solid place from the surface,
         it’s actually extremely active just 
        below the surface. It's four basic layers are: 
        a solid crust, a hot, nearly solid mantle, a liquid outer core and a solid inner core. </p>
        <p></p>
        
<h3>The jargon + Who does what</h3>
        <p>Hazard: the study of earthquakes and their effects, where they occur, to what extent they might impact land and communities and their frequency (these studies are carried out by a seismologist).</p>

        <p>Vulnerability of structures: prevent collapse and minimise structural damage (these studies are carried out by an earthquake engineer).</p>
          
        <p>Risk: the world of alerts, warnings and alarms for preparation and emergency response (the tasks of management and operating staff).</p>

<h2>The maps</h2>

      <p1>The below maps are based on a dataset that is a geocoded extension of a selection of disasters from the Centre for Research on 
        the Epidemiology of Disasters’ (CRED) emergency events database (EM-DAT) (Guha-Sapir, 
        Below, and Hoyois, 2014). The dataset encompasses 39,953 locations for 9,924 disastersthat
        occurred worldwide in the years 1960 to 2018. The map solely focuses on those disasters coded as earthquakes only
        from 1960 to 1999 (first map) and from 2000 to 2018 (second map).</p1> <br> <br>
        <p1>If you would like to visually compare two specific locations and their seismic activities over time, then you can simply center both maps in the area of interest. You can zoom in and out with your mouse tracker for an easier navigation.</p1>

      <h2>What tools we can use to better understand where earthquakes can occure?</h2>
      <p>The EVI, short for Environmental Sustainablity Index, is based on 50 indicators for estimating the vulnerability of the environment of a 
        country to future shocks. These indicators are combined by simple averaging and reported 
        simultaneously as a single index, a range of policy-relevant thematic sub-indices and as a 
        profile showing the results for each indicator. </p>

      <p>The EVI has been designed to reflect the extent to which the natural 
        environment of a country is prone to damage and degradation. </p>
      <p>It does not address the vulnerability of the social, cultural or economic systems, nor the environment that has become 
        dominated by those same human systems (such as cities and farms) because these are 
        included in the economic and social vulnerability indices which are needed separately to 
        identify trade-offs. Therefore, the natural environment includes those biophysical systems that
        can be sustained without direct and/or continuing human support. The environment at risk 
        includes ecosystems, habitats, populations and communities of organisms, physical and 
        biological processes (such as beach building and reproduction), productivity and energy 
        flows, diversity at all levels, and interactions among them all. Each of these ecosystem goods, 
        services and relationships may be affected by natural and human hazards, the risk of which 
        may vary with time, place and human choices and behaviour.
      </p>
    <p>The EVI scores range as follows: </p>
      <table class = "table">
        <tr>
          <td style="font-style:bold;">Vulnerability</td>
          <td>Overall Score</td>
          
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="color:red;">Extremely vulnerable </td>
            <td>      365+</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="color:rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.685);">Highly vulnerable</td>
            <td>315-364 </td>

          <tr>

 <!-- text content 1 -->

      <div class="long-text" id="text-one">
      <p1>Preparing for an earthquake is not easy, however, it is vital to react promptly; lucidity is key.<br> How to prepare? Get your family to practice a drill; make sure your children understand the importance of following a few simple instructions in a difficult situation.
    <br>Example of a drill: drop down ont your hands and knees to protect yourself from falling; cover your head and neck underneath a stable and studry surface (where possible). 
  In case there is no safe shelter, try to get as close as possible to an interior wall or a furniture (low-lying) that will unlikely fall on you. Avoid windows and glass surfaces.
</p1>
    <p1>Another key step of planning ahead is to ensure there is an evacuation plan and an emergency kit. These two steps do not take long to prepare in normal conditions, but can save many lives
      if in an emergency situation.
