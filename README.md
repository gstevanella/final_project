# Shake me up

Abstract or short description of the project.

This project is aimed at raising awarness about the natural phenomenon of earthquakes and land movements. 
The project would like to be an explorative experience and the goal is to instill and stimulate the user's curiosity.

I imagined my project as an instrument that could stimulate people’s curiosity; aimed at raising awareness on earthquakes, but also interest around geography and geology.

I would like to drive the user’s attention to interesting tools such as the NASA indices, i.e. Environmental Vulnerability Indices, that could help decisionmakers in relation, for example, to urbanisation-related policies. 

The interactive agenda suggested is made of three main parts which highlight, respectively, where some of the latest earthquakes occurred; what is the Environmental Vulnerability Index associated with each country, and its earthquake specific component; and the impact (in terms of death toll) of some of the major earthquakes.
